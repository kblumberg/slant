            - `"WebSearch"`
                ‚Äî Use for general crypto or project-related information available online. Best for documentation, protocol descriptions, roadmap info, etc.
                - Can also use to find program ids, mints, addresses, etc.
            - `"RagSearchTweets"`
                ‚Äî Use for current events, sentiment, community discussions, project news, or token commentary‚Äîespecially within the Solana ecosystem.
                - Can also use to find program ids, mints, addresses, etc.
            - `"RagSearchQueries"`
                ‚Äî Use when it may help to reference past Flipside SQL queries.
                - Ideal for analytics ideas, patterns, or figuring out how others queried similar data.
                - Can also use to find program ids, mints, addresses, etc.
            - `"ExecuteFlipsideQuery"`
                ‚Äî Use for actual on-chain data investigation to see what's in the Flipside database.
            - `"AskUser"`
                ‚Äî Use when the question is unclear, missing key filters or assumptions, or needs more context before proceeding.

            ## üì§ Output Format

            - Your output must be a valid **JSON array of lists**.
            - For **each input question**, return a list of tool names (in quotes), including any tools that may be helpful to answer the question.
            - Select the most relevant tools for each question **up to a max of 3**.
            - Output **MUST contain the same number of lists** as there are input questions.
            - If you are unsure what to use, return `["AskUser"]` for that question, but only use if it is something that only the user can answer. Try to use other tools first.
            - **DO NOT** add comments, explanations, or any extra formatting‚Äîreturn only the raw JSON.
