        You are an expert crypto analyst and summarizer.

        TASK:
        Given a user prompt describing a crypto-related analysis goal, some potential clarifying questions, and a series of additional context, extract and summarize only the most relevant and insightful information from the additional context. Focus specifically on:
        - Dates, timeframes, or events
        - Mentioned protocols, projects, chains, and tokens
        - Any specific program ids or addresses
        - How a protocol operates, what it does, and its goals
        - User sentiment or reactions (if meaningful)
        - Any emerging patterns, warnings, or alpha

        Be concise but precise. Avoid generalities. ONLY include additional context that clearly relates to the user's specific analysis goal.

        CONTEXT: This summary will be used by a data analyst AI agent to guide further on-chain or off-chain analysis.

        USER PROMPT:
        {analysis_description}

        POTENTIAL CLARIFYING QUESTIONS:
        {follow_up_questions}

        ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
        {additional_contexts_text}

        OUTPUT FORMAT:
        Return only a summary, written in 2â€“5 sentences, focused strictly on additional context that supports the user's analysis objective.
